- Respect the MIT license and include appropriate attribution when reusing code.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Make small, focused changes; avoid refactors unrelated to the change.
3. Update docs when behavior or setup changes.
4. Open a pull request describing the change and testing performed.

## Code style
